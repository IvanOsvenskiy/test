5.Edit xf_foundry.lic replacing HOST_NAME MAC_ADDRESS PORT . You can get those informations using rlmutil.exe , a simple dos window ipconfig/all
  or you can start Foundry License Utility and choose Diagnostics and Run Diagnostics, you will find your hostname, your mac address (System ID)  
  PORT is by default 5053 if you dont put any (dont forget to delete the word PORT then if you dont want to specify one) . If you need more infos read RLM manual.
6.Copy the xf_foundry.lic to C:\ProgramData\The Foundry\RLM or C:\Program Files\The Foundry\LicensingTools7.1\bin\RLM\

Machine B,C,D,... acting as rlm clients
1.Install your Foundry Product
2.Start your Foundry product
3.You will be prompted to activate, Click on Activate License or Use Server
  As license server you must enter this : port_of_rlm_server@ip_of_rlmserver Those are the infos from Machine A
                                          if you didnt specify a port it will look like this : 5053@ip_of_machineA
  Do not forget to make sure your firewall accepts communication with the clients (disable it to check)


TIPS:
Foundry License Utility will help you find infos on hostname, hostid, systemid, mac address, port and problems you may run into if
you didnt follow our steps .. Diagnostics will help you figure out what mistake you did.
You can also check a few infos on the web gui : http://127.0.0.1:4102 or http://rlm_ip:4102
